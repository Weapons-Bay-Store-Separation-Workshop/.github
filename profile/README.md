# AIAA Weapons Bay Store Separation Workshop

## Overview:
* The Weapons Bay Store Separation Workshop (WBS²W) brings together researchers and engineers from government, industry, and academia to address challenges in CFD-based prediction of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic phenomena affecting store separation from internal weapons bays. 
* The workshop aims to foster collaboration and discussion on methodologies, computational approaches, modeling techniques, challenges, and best practices for weapons bay store separation simulations.
* The workshop focuses on studing both a generic cavity model and a benchmark jet-fighter weapons bay configuration to bridge prediction insights from basic to applied geometries of current-generation CFD codes.

## Goals:
* **Evaluate** the effectiveness of existing CFD codes and methods for an applied benchmark weapons bay store separation configuration.
* **Develop** practical modeling guidelines for CFD prediction of applied weapons bay store separation problems.
* **Determine** what elements of cavity flow physics are essential for modeling to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Identify** potential areas requiring further research and development.

**Sponsored by the AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Technical Committee (APATC)**

## Organizing Committee:
* **Dr. David Bacci** (Senior Research Fellow, University of Oxford/Cranfield Defence and Security)
* **Dr. Andreas Goerttler** (Research Associate, DLR - German Aerospace Center)
* **Prof. Alistair J. Saddington** (Professor, Cranfield University, Defence Academy of the United Kingdom)
* **Dr. Hadar Ben-Gida** (Research Fellow, Technion Israel Institute of Technology)

## Working Groups (WGs)
There are two WGs, each studying a unique case, proceeding in parallel:
* **WG1: Generic Jet-Fighter Weapon Bay Configuration**
  * *Case study*: Generic Jet-Fighter Weapon Bay model
  * *Goal*: Bridging the knowledge gap between basic cavity and airframe-installed weapons bay
  * *Modelling approaches*: URANS / RANS-LES / LBM / WMLES
* **WG2: Generic Cavity Model**
  * *Case study*: DLR’s Generic Cavity model
  * *Goal*: Gaining improved insights into cavity flow physics, with specific attention to state-of-the-art CFD codes tailored for detailed resolution 
  * *Modelling approaches*: up to DNS
