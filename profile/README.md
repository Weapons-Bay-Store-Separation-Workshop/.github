# AIAA Weapons Bay Store Separation Workshop

The Weapons Bay Store Separation Workshop (WBS²W) brings together researchers and engineers from government, industry, and academia to address challenges in CFD-based prediction of aerodynamic and aeroacoustic phenomena affecting store separation from internal weapons bays. 
The workshop aims to foster collaboration and discussion on methodologies, computational approaches, modeling techniques, challenges, and best practices for weapons bay store separation simulations.
The workshop focuses on studing both a generic cavity model and a benchmark jet-fighter weapons bay configuration to bridge prediction insights from basic to applied geometries of current-generation CFD codes.

## Workshop goals:
* **Evaluate** the effectiveness of existing CFD codes and methods for an applied benchmark weapons bay store separation configuration.
* **Develop** practical modeling guidelines for CFD prediction of applied weapons bay store separation problems.
* **Determine** what elements of cavity flow physics are essential for modeling to improve prediction accuracy.
* **Identify** potential areas requiring further research and development.
